# emailvalidation
Command line utility to validate email addresses.

If you don't want to install any packages, run without any flags. For more robust validation, install with
`pip install -r reqirements`
and run with the `-d` flag.

For extreme confirmation, run with the `-g` flag and specify a gmail account to use to send a confirmation email. This is the weirdest method of doing this via command line, but it is the most accurate one. I do not recommend it.
